# Lake

Lake (Lean Make) is a new build system and package manager for Lean 4.
With Lake, package configuration is written in Lean inside a dedicated `package.lean` file stored in the root of the package directory. Each `package.lean` includes a `package` definition (akin to `main`) which defines the package's configuration.

## Building and Running Lake

As Lake functions as an alternative to `leanpkg`, it is not built with it. Instead, there is a pre-packaged `build.sh` shell script which is used to build Lake. It passes it arguments down to a `make` command. So, if you have more than one core, you will probably want to use a `-jX` option to specify how many build tasks you want it to run in parallel. For example:

```shell
$ ./build.sh -j4
```

After building, the `lake` binary will be located at `build/bin/lake` and the library's `.olean` files will be located directly in `build`.

### Building with nix flakes

It is also possible to build lake with the nix setup `buildLeanPackage` from lean4. To do this you need to have nix installed with flakes enabled. It is recommended to have set up the lean4 binary cache as described in the lean4 repo.
It is then possible to build lake with `nix build .` or run it from anywhere with `nix run github:leanprover/lake`.

A development environment with lean installed can be loaded automatically by running `nix develop` or automatically on `cd` with direnv by running `direnv allow`.

The versions of nixpkgs and lean4 are fixed to specific hashes. They can be updated by running `nix flake update`.

### Augmenting Lake's Search Path

The `lake` executable needs to know where to find the `.olean` files for the modules used in the package configuration file. Lake will intelligently setup an initial search path based on the location of its own executable and `lean`.

Specifically, if Lake is co-located with `lean` (i.e., there is `lean` executable in the same directory as itself), it will assume it was installed with Lean and that both Lean and Lake are located in `<lean-home>/bin` with Lean's `.olean` files at `<lean-home/lib/lean` and Lake's at `.olean` files at `<lean-home/lib/lake`. Otherwise, it will run `lean --print-prefix` to find Lean's home and assume that its `.olean` files are at `<lean-home>/lib/lean` and that `lake` is at `<lake-home>/bin/lake` with its `.olean` files at `<lake-home>`.

This search path can be augmented by including other directories of `.olean` files in the `LEAN_PATH` environment variable. Such directories will take precedence over the initial search path, so `LEAN_PATH` can also be used to correct Lake's search if the `.olean` files for Lean (or Lake itself) are in non-standard locations.

## Creating and Building a Package

We can set up a new package by running `lake init <package-name>` in a fresh directory. For example, we can create the package `hello` like so:

```
$ mkdir hello
$ cd hello
$ lake init hello
```

This will initialize a git repository in the directory with a basic `.gitignore` that ignores the build directory (i.e., `build`) where Lake outputs build files.

It will also create the root Lean file for the package, which uses the capitalized version of the package's name (e.g., `Hello.lean` in this example). It contains the following dummy "Hello World" program:

```lean
def main : IO Unit :=
  IO.println "Hello, world!"
```

Lake also creates a basic `package.lean` for the package:

```lean
import Lake.Package

def package : Lake.PackageConfig := {
  name := "hello"
  version := "0.1"
}
```

along with a `lean-toolchain` file that contains the version string of the currently active Lean, which tells [`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) to use that Lean toolchain for the package.

The command `lake build-bin` can then be used to build the package (and its dependencies, if it has them) into a native executable. The result will be placed in `build/bin`.

```
$ lake build-bin
...
$ ./build/bin/hello
Hello, world!
```

## Configuration Options

Lake provides a large assortment of configuration options for packages.

### General

* `name` **(Required)**: The name of the package.
* `version` **(Required)**: The version string of the package.
* `moduleRoot`: The root module of the package. Imports relative to this root (e.g., `Pkg.Foo`) are considered part of the package. Defaults to the package's uppercase `name`.
* `dependencies`: A `List` of the package's dependencies.
* `depsDir`: The directory to which Lake should download dependencies. Defaults to `lean_packages`.
* `extraDepTarget`: An extra `OpaqueTarget` that should be built before the package.
* `leanArgs`: An `Array` of additional arguments to pass to `lean` while compiling Lean source files.
* `srcDir`: The directory containing the package's Lean source files. Defaults to the package's directory. (This will be passed to `lean` as the `-R` option.)
* `buildDir`: The directory to which Lake should output the package's build results. Defaults to `build`.
* `oleanDir`: The build subdirectory to which Lake should output the package's `.olean` files. Defaults to `lib`.
* `scripts`: A `HashMap` of scripts for the package. A `Script` is an arbitrary `(args : List String) â†’ IO PUnit` function that is indexed by a `String` key and can be be run by `lake run <key> [-- <args>]`.

### Library / Binary Compilation

* `leancArgs`: An `Array` additional arguments to pass to `leanc` while compiling the C source files generated by `lean`.
* `irDir`: The build subdirectory to which Lake should output the package's intermediary results (e.g., `.c` and `.o` files). Defaults to `ir`.
* `libName`: The name of the package's static library. Defaults to the string representation of the package's `moduleRoot`.
* `libDir`: The build subdirectory to which Lake should output the package's static library. Defaults to `lib`.
* `binName`: The name of the package's binary executable. Defaults to the package's `name`.
* `binDir`: The build subdirectory to which Lake should output the package's binary executable. Defaults to `bin`.
* `binRoot`: The root module of the package's binary executable. Defaults to the package's `moduleRoot`. This setting is most useful for packages that are distributing both a library and a binary (like Lake itself). In such cases, it is common for there to be code (e.g., `main`) that is needed for the binary but should not be included in the library proper.
* `moreLibTargets`: Additional library `FileTarget`s (beyond the package's and its dependencies' libraries) to build and link to the package's binary executable (and/or to dependent package's executables).
* `linkArgs`: Additional arguments to pass to `leanc` while compiling the package's binary executable. These will come *after* the paths of libraries built with `moreLibTargets`.
