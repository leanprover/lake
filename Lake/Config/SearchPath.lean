/--
Initializes the search path the Lake executable
uses when interpreting package configuration files.

In order to use the Lean stdlib (e.g., `Init`),
the executable needs the search path to include the directory
with the stdlib's `.olean` files (e.g., from `<lean-home>/lib/lean`).
In order to use Lake's modules as well, the search path also
needs to include Lake's `.olean` files (e.g., from `build`).

While this can be done by having the user augment `LEAN_PATH` with
the necessary directories, Lake also intelligently augments the initial
search path with the `.olean` directories of the provided Lean and Lake
installations.

See `findInstall?` for more information on how Lake determines those
directories. If everything is configured as expected, the user will not
need to augment `LEAN_PATH`. Otherwise, they will need to provide Lake
with more information (either through `LEAN_PATH` or through other options).
